These films can be reacted in a second step with various organic and inorganic nucleophiles to obtain functionalized surfaces. When acetonitrile is used as solvent, coating takes place through direct arylation of the surface by the diazonium salt, yielding a film composed primarily of polyphenylenes. Oxide surfaces do not participate in this reaction very rapidly in acetonitrile, but can be quickly coated by solvolysis of PPBD with water as the solvent, yielding a poly(hydroxyazobenzene) film produced by azo coupling. Coatings 50-60 nm thick can be obtained with PPBD in water, while films from acetonitrile can reach 6-8 nm in thickness. Both techniques allow for surface coverage of functional groups greater than that of a single self-assembled monolayer. The rate constant of redox reactions occurring in immobilized species is reasonably rapid, on the order of 30 s-1. The bisulfate salt formed during PPBD synthesis should not be isolated due to potential explosion hazard. PPBD salts could be stored on the bench in a sealed vial for days without detectable degradation in the case of tetrafluoroborate and with only minor cosmetic darkening for hexafluorophosphate. The procedure is easy and quick, making it promising for practical surface modification, electrochemical and optical sensors, as well as other devices involving immobilized complex molecules."
