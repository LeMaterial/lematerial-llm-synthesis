      "notes": "Typical crystals had a surface area between 1 -2 mm2 and were 0.5 mm thick. Prior to mounting the sample for strain measurement, the crystal's in-plane axes must be distinguished to select the strain axis. This is accomplished via x-ray diffraction by utilizing the forbidden extinctions of the Cmcm space group. (0, K, L) peaks are permitted for even values of K, while (H, K, 0) peaks are only permitted if both H and K are even. Hence by comparing amplitudes of the (0, 6, 1), an allowed reflection, with (1, 6, 0), its forbidden counterpart, the a and c axes can be distinguished. No intensity was observed at the forbidden reflection, within the resolution of our measurement, indicating samples measured do not exhibit any stacking faults in which the a and c crystal axes are reversed."

      "reasoning": "The extraction provides a basic outline of the ErTe3 single crystal synthesis using a self-flux method. The structural completeness is limited as the specific details of the synthesis procedure (temperature, duration, ratios of starting materials) are not available in the text. Material extraction is incomplete due to missing quantities and units. The process steps are rudimentary, consisting of only a single 'synthesize' action. Equipment is not specified. Conditions are entirely missing. Semantic accuracy is maintained at a high level, but the lack of detail impacts the overall utility. Format compliance is good, but the limited information reduces the score. Overall, the extraction captures the high-level concept but lacks the granular details needed for reproducibility.",
