This setup is equipped with femtosecond titanium-sapphire laser (Spectra-Physics Tsunami, Santa Clara, CA, USA) delivering 100 fs pulses at a wavelength of 790 nm with 82 MHz repetition rate. The energy of a single pulse was 15 nJ. The laser beam was then focused by Zeiss Plan-Neofluar 40x/0.75 objective and formed a spot with 1.2 \u03bcm in diameter on the sample surface. The beam was attenuated with an acoustic-optical filter to the energy level of 6.25nJ per pulse at the focal plane of the microscope objective. The investigated samples were placed onto the stage of the microscope without cover glass. CNT array treatment was achieved by scanning line-by-line at 512 lines per scan resolution. The scan speed was about 145 mm/s. The dimension of the scan area could be varied from 230 \u00d7 230 \u03bcm to 30 \u00d7 30 \u03bcm. Zoom factor of the microscope was chosen equal or greater to the required Nyquist criterion to ensure the focal spot overlaps between neighboring lines. Three-dimensional scanning is achieved with a built-in Z-axis drive. The step of Z-axis was chosen to be 1 \u03bcm, again to ensure the spatial overlapping of the focal spot between neighboring planes."
