The flow rate of NH3 (200 sccm) is also correctly extracted. However, the heating and cooling rates are not specified, which reduces the score slightly. The pressure is not mentioned, which is acceptable if it was performed at atmospheric pressure.",

        "semantic_accuracy_reasoning": "The extraction generally preserves the scientific meaning of the synthesis procedure. The relationships between the materials, steps, equipment, and conditions are correctly represented. However, the lack of specific amounts for some starting materials slightly detracts from the semantic accuracy, as it makes it harder to reproduce the synthesis.",
