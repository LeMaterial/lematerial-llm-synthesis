The material extraction is mostly accurate, although the precursor name could be improved for clarity. The process steps are logically sequenced, and the equipment is implicitly ALD reactor. The conditions extraction is generally good, but pressure is missing. Semantic accuracy is maintained, and the format generally complies with the schema. However, there are some areas for improvement, particularly in specifying the ALD reactor and including pressure information.",

        "material_extraction_reasoning": "Material names and amounts are generally accurate. The precursor name is correctly identified, but could be more precise. Units are correctly extracted. Purity is not specified in the text, so its absence is acceptable.",
