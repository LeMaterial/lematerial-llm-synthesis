The product (dark powder), which is about 2 g per vessel, was then cooled down to room temperature. The multivessel high pressure rotor was used for the MW synthesis work, where only four of the fifteen reactor positions were more than enough to prepare large quantity (>8 g) of the desired materials in a single run."
