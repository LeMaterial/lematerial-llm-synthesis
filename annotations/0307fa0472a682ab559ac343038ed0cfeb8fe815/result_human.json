The resultant materials exhibit high crystallinity, phase purity, and platelet morphology. The surface chemistry showed a mixture of metallic and oxide phases, and zeta-potential analysis exhibited a systematic change of isoelectric point with composition. As-made materials were directly sintered into pellets using SPS. The method paves the way for large-scale production and implementation towards large-area thermoelectric (TE) applications, including the potential for fabricating hybrid thermoelectric films and complete TE devices by combining n-type and p-type materials. The process involves the reduction of Bi3+/Sb3+ ions by ethylene glycol, which then catalyzes the bond breaking between Te and TOP to form the crystalline Bi2−xSbxTe3 phase."
