Optically, Sn-alloying blue-shifts the LSPR from the visible (~400 nm for the Ag seeds) to the UV (365 nm at 23% Sn content). With increasing Sn content, the LSPR lineshape asymmetrically broadens toward the blue, possibly due to the formation of new interband transitions. However, a clear Ag-LSPR-like extinction feature is maintained up to ~23% Sn incorporation. Like in the Au-Sn system, XRD reveals the formation of intermetallic phase (Ag3Sn) with greater added Sn amounts. Shifting and broadening of the fcc (111) peak is observed for the low Sn content nanoparticles, indicative of substitutional alloying. Ag3Sn phase content is seen to increase with increased added Sn equivalents. Mie simulations incorporating linearly-weighted Ag and Sn dielectric functions qualitatively capture the blue-shifted LSPRs of the Ag-Sn combinations. Overall, the optical, structural, and theoretical data show that an Ag-like LSPR is retained while tunability towards higher energy can be achieved."
