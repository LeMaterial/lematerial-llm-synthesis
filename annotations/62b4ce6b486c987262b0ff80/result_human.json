Temperature-dependent experiments were conducted to manipulate the diffusion of Sn into the Au seed and to probe the relation between optical and structural properties. Synthesis at 60ËšC was found to give the most blue-shifted Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) and the greatest relative amount of Au5Sn phase.",
