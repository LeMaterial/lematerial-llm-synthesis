  "notes": "The GNRs were prepared using bottom-up chemical synthesis methods, specifically mentioning CVD-grown AGNRs and a 9-AGNR sample prepared by the UHV method. The study primarily characterizes the electrical behavior of these GNR films, noting a width-dependent behavior in output current and the influence of GNR length on device performance. Detailed synthesis procedures, including specific starting materials, their amounts, or the exact equipment used for GNR synthesis, are not provided within the text."
