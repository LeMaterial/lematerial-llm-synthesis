The key starting materials and the descriptions of the two main synthesis steps (formation of WFe2Ni-red from WFe2, and WFe2Ni-ox from WFe2Ni-red) are included. The characterization equipment used to study these compounds is also identified. However, the source text is a research paper focusing on electronic structure and characterization rather than a detailed synthesis procedure. Consequently, specific quantitative details for materials (amount, purity, vendor), detailed synthesis equipment, and precise reaction conditions (temperature, duration, pressure, stirring, atmosphere, pH) for each step are largely absent in the source and therefore in the extraction. The synthesis of the precursor WFe2 is also not detailed in the provided excerpt.
