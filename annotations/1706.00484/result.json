Specifically, the ratios of gases used in the annealing step are not captured as amounts with units, and the equipment used for annealing is not specified. The description of the AFM is present in the notes, but not as a separate equipment entry. The wet chemical synthesis method is correctly identified, but the lack of specific starting materials is a notable omission, as the SrTiO3 substrate itself is the starting material. Overall, the extraction is reasonably accurate but could be improved with more detail and better adherence to the schema for quantities and equipment.",
