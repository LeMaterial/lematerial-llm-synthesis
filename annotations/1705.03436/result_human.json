Judging from the formability and solubility of KOH in a BHF solution, one can conjecture that the surface is predominantly terminated by TaO2.

AES measurements were also used to confirm the NdO termination for annealed surfaces, where Ga and O are depleted from. Cavallaro et al. annealed the substrate at a high temperature of 1000 °C under different gas fluxes and showed that, irrespective of various gas types, NdGaO3 surfaces always end up with the A-site rich termination as verified by Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS). Thermal annealing seems to allow the evaporation of gallium ions from the surface by forming volatile species Ga2O. In order to alter the surface termination, solutions of BHF or HCl+NH4Cl were tested as an etchant and the result was analyzed by RHEED; indeed, B-site termination was successfully achieved by the etching method on NdGaO3 surfaces. From these various studies on NdGaO3 (001) substrates, it is now established that high temperature annealing is sufficient to produce A-site terminated atomically flat smooth NdGaO3 surfaces."

The equipment extraction is missing entirely.
