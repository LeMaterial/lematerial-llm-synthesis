Radovic *et*  *al.* demonstrated that a constant flow of pure oxygen at 1200 \u00b0 C for 20 h also produces atomically flat surfaces with single termination for NdGaO3 (001) substrates, again confirmed by XPS; Talik *et al.* also showed the A-site termination using a similar method. AES measurements were also used to confirm the NdO termination for annealed surfaces, where Ga and O are depleted from. Cavallaro *et al.* annealed the substrate at a high temperature of 1000 \u00b0C under different gas fluxes and showed that, irrespective of various gas types, NdGaO3 surfaces always end up with the A-site rich termination as verified by Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS). Thermal annealing seems to allow the evaporation of gallium ions from the surface by forming volatile species Ga2O. In order to alter the surface termination, solutions of BHF or HCl+NH4Cl were tested as an etchant and the result was analyzed by RHEED; indeed, B-site termination was successfully achieved by the etching method on NdGaO3 surfaces. From these various studies on NdGaO3 (001) substrates, it is now established that high temperature annealing is sufficient to produce A-site terminated atomically flat smooth NdGaO3 surfaces."
