It identifies the starting materials, including the SrIrO3 target and Nb-doped SrTiO3 substrate. The process steps are well-defined, including etching, annealing, and deposition. The equipment used - the PLD/MBE 2300 and RHEED - is also extracted. The synthesis conditions, including temperature, pressure, and atmosphere, are mostly captured; only missing thing was the HF buffer pH. Furthermore, the Nb-doped SrTiO3 was initially assigned the wt% doping as 'purity', which is incorrect nd was rectified. The PLD/MBE 2300, PVD Solutions is the name of the instrument, not the method. Other than these, the extraction is reasonably complete and accurate.",
