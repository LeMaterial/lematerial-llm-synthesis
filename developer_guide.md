# Developer Guide

This file contains information for developers for this project. Please make sure to install the project as described in the [README.md](README.md).

TL;DR

```
uv sync
uv pip install -e .
uv pip install <package-name> # install package without adding to pyproject.toml
uv add <package-name> # install and add package to project dependencies
```

## FAQs

<details>
<summary>What are API keys and why do I need them?</summary>
API keys are credentials used to authenticate with external services (e.g., LLM providers, OCR APIs). You store them in your .env file so our code can securely access these services without hardcoding secrets. **Under no circumstance should you share your API key, post or commit it anywhere!** You can get API keys on the websites of the respective providers.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is uv sync and do I need it?</summary>
`uv` is a fantastic, light-weight and user-friendly dependency manager -- think of it as an alternative to `pip`. `uv sync` installs all dependencies defined in pyproject.toml into your virtual environment. Always run it after pulling changes to ensure you have the latest required packages.
</details>
<details>
<summary>My code doesn't compile and the issue is not resolved after consolidating ChatGPT for ~10 min. What do I do?</summary>
Please raise an issue in the GitHub repository with details about the error, steps to reproduce, and any relevant logs or screenshots (important for us to reproduce!). Our team will triage and help resolve it.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a pre-commit hook?</summary>
A pre-commit hook is a script that runs before each git commit. It ensures, for example, that the code adheres to python style guides. We use `uvx pre-commit install` to enforce formatting and linting automatically, catching issues early.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a lock file?</summary>
The lock file (`uv.lock`) pins exact versions of all dependencies. This ensures consistent installs across machines and CI runs. If `uv` causes issues for you, deleting the lock file and `.venv/` directory and reinstalling might do the job.

## Installation

See the [README.md](README.md) for installation instructions. Make sure that the import `uv run python -c "import llm_synthesis"` works without error messages. Afterwards, install the pre-commit hook:

```
uvx pre-commit install
```

## Git Best Practices

### Branches

The main branch is reserved for the stable version of the code. When adding a new feature, we open a new _branch_ and _merge_ it with the main branch using a _pull request_:

```
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/new-feature-name
```

### Commit Messages

Make a habit of committing and pushing your code regularly (`git add <file-to-add> | git commit -m "commit message" | git push`)! Use the Conventional Commits style:

- feat: for new features
- fix: for bug fixes
- docs: for documentation changes
- style: for formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- refactor: for refactoring code
- test: for adding or updating tests

Example:

```
‚ùå add markdown script
‚úÖ feat(extraction): support image embedding in markdown output
```

### Pre-commit Formatting & Linting

Format and lint all Python files before committing:

```
uvx ruff format
uvx ruff check
```

To make sure that the linting configurations between your IDE and the pyproject.toml do not conflict, please create teh file `.vscode/settings.json` and set it to:

```
{
    "ruff.configuration": "pyproject.toml",
    "ruff.nativeServer": "on",
    "ruff.organizeImports": true,
    "ruff.fixAll": true,
    "notebook.formatOnSave.enabled": true,
    "notebook.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "notebook.source.fixAll": "explicit",
        "notebook.source.organizeImports": "explicit"
    },
    "[python]": {
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
            "source.organizeImports": "explicit",
            "source.fixAll": "explicit"
        },
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff",
    },
}
```

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Open a PR from your feature branch into `main`.
Link issues you are addressing (e.g., Closes #123).
Add a PR description:

```
Brief summary of changes

Any migration steps

Screenshots or examples if applicable
```

Respond to review comments promptly.
Squash & merge when approved.

## Documentation

After implementing any new feature, make sure to document it properly!

- README.md (if applicable): High-level overview and quickstart.
- Developer Guide (if applicable): (this file) for contributor onboarding.
- Docstrings (**mandatory, including type hints!**): ensure public APIs are documented.
- Notebooks (if applicable): examples and exploratory work under notebooks/.
